# PCI-Bus-Arbiter
Verilog implementation of a PCI Bus Arbiter for arbitrating four processors 

In a multiprocessor system, several processors share the same system bus, like a PCI bus. A system based on multiprocessors can work in a coordinated manner only if bus arbitration is in force. The PCI Bus Arbiter design that we are going to implement is for arbitrating four processors.
